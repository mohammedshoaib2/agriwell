        'Applying fungicides when symptoms first appear can reduce the spread of the leaf mold fungus significantly. Several fungicides are labeled for leaf mold control on tomatoes and can provide good disease control if applied to all the foliage of the plant, especially the lower surfaces of the leaves.',

        'There are no cures for viral diseases, such as the mosaic virus, once a plant is infected. As a result, every effort should be made to prevent the disease from entering your garden. To create a solution that prevents and treats disease, add a heaping tablespoon of baking soda, a teaspoon of vegetable oil, and a small amount of mild soap to a gallon of water and spray the tomato plants with this solution. This needs to be reapplied regularly to maintain its efficiency.',
